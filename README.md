# Open-Folder
Adds a Powercord command that allows you to open a path on your computer.  

Has some shorthands, like:
- bd : opens your BetterDiscord folder, given that you have bdCompat installed.
- pc : opens your Powercord plugins folder.
- as : opens the Astra plugins folder, mainly just for me :)
### Possibly Coming Soon
- Custom shorthands  

### Currently Unsupported 
Any Windows path shorthands like:  
- %PATH%
- %userprofile%
- %appdata%
